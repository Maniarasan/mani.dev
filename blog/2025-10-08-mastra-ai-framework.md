Mastra.ai is a TypeScript-first AI agent framework that lets you build, manage, integrate tools (including MCP), and deploy agents with ease. You get graph-based workflow orchestration, persistent memory, unified SDK for switching providers, RAG/data sync, and powerful cloud hosting out of the box. If you want a developer-friendly framework to ship real AI agents, Mastra is worth checking out.
