## Introduction
Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) has become essential for adapting pre-trained models to specific tasks. However, traditional fine-tuning and Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods like LoRA take fundamentally different approaches. Understanding these differences is crucial for choosing the right strategy for your use case.
## Traditional Fine-Tuning with GPT Models
### How It Works
Traditional fine-tuning updates **all parameters** across the entire model during training. When you fine-tune a GPT model (like GPT-2, GPT-3, or GPT-4), the optimizer modifies weights in:
- **All transformer layers** (attention and feed-forward networks)
- **Embedding layers** (token and positional embeddings)
- **Output layers** (language modeling head)
This approach creates a completely new copy of the model with updated weights throughout the entire architecture.
### Layers Affected
- **Every layer**: All attention mechanisms (Q, K, V projections), feed-forward networks, layer norms, and embeddings
- **Total trainable parameters**: 100% of model parameters
### Advantages
- Maximum adaptation capability
- Best performance for highly specialized tasks
- No architectural constraints
### Disadvantages
- **Memory intensive**: Requires storing full model gradients and optimizer states
- **Storage heavy**: Each fine-tuned model requires full parameter storage (GBs to TBs)
- **Computationally expensive**: Training costs scale with full model size
- **Risk of catastrophic forgetting**: Model may lose general capabilities
## LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) and PEFT
### How It Works
LoRA freezes the original pre-trained weights and injects **trainable rank decomposition matrices** into specific layers. Instead of updating W directly, LoRA adds a low-rank update: W' = W + BA, where B and A are small matrices with rank r â‰ª d.
### Layers Affected
LoRA typically targets:
- **Attention layers**: Query (Q) and Value (V) projection matrices
- **Optionally**: Key (K) projections and feed-forward layers
- **Original weights**: Remain frozen
The key difference: LoRA adds **adapter matrices** alongside frozen weights rather than modifying the base model.
