## Overview

Prompt engineering steers LLM behavior with instructions, examples, and constraints.
Good prompts are **explicit**, **structured**, and **evaluated** like any other component.
## Why it matters

- Reduce ambiguity and control output format.
- Lower costs via shorter, more focused prompts.
- Improve safety and reliability with guardrails.
## Step-by-step

1. Define success metrics (accuracy, JSON validity, latency).
2. Use roles, goals, constraints, and examples (few‑shot).
3. Demand structured output with JSON schemas.
4. Iterate with real user queries; measure and refine.
## Examples

```python
# JSON-constrained prompting — Python Example (2025)
schema = {
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {"sentiment": {"type": "string"}, "evidence": {"type": "string"}},
  "required": ["sentiment"]
}
prompt = f"Classify sentiment and return JSON matching this schema: {schema}"
print("Use your LLM client to call with this prompt.")
```

```js
// Function calling / tool use (shape) — Node.js Example (2025)
// Describe your tool signature and let the LLM decide arguments.
// Actual API call depends on the provider; this is a conceptual shape.
const tools = [{ name: "search", parameters: { q: "string" } }];
const prompt = "If you need web info, call the search tool; else answer directly.";
console.log("Call your LLM with tool definitions and handle callbacks.");
```
## Key Takeaways

- Be explicit about output shape to avoid brittle parsing.
- Few-shot beats zero-shot for many tasks; test both.
- Document prompt changes and track versions.
## Next Steps

- Adopt a prompt registry and A/B test changes.
- Combine prompts with retrieval and tools for robustness.
