## Overview

Transformers power today’s language and vision models by using **self‑attention** to model long‑range dependencies without recurrence.
Instead of processing sequences step‑by‑step like RNNs, a transformer looks at all tokens at once, learning which tokens should attend to which.
This architectural shift enables parallel training and scales extremely well.
## Why it matters

- Understand why transformers replaced RNN/LSTM for most NLP tasks.
- Know the roles of encoder, decoder, and attention heads.
- Build intuition to read model docs and configure inference parameters.
## Step-by-step

1. Tokenize text into subwords (e.g., BPE).
2. Embed tokens into vectors; add positional encodings.
3. Apply stacked self‑attention + feed‑forward blocks.
4. Train with next‑token prediction or masked‑language objectives.
## Examples

```python
# Self-attention (toy) — Python Example (2025)
import torch
import torch.nn.functional as F

torch.manual_seed(0)
x = torch.randn(1, 4, 8)  # [batch, seq, dim]
Q = x @ torch.randn(8, 8)
K = x @ torch.randn(8, 8)
V = x @ torch.randn(8, 8)

scores = (Q @ K.transpose(-2, -1)) / (8 ** 0.5)
weights = F.softmax(scores, dim=-1)
out = weights @ V
print(out.shape)  # torch.Size([1, 4, 8])
```

```js
// Self-attention (toy) — Node.js Example (2025)
function softmax(arr){
  const m = Math.max(...arr);
  const exps = arr.map(v => Math.exp(v - m));
  const sum = exps.reduce((a,b)=>a+b,0);
  return exps.map(v => v/sum);
}
// This is just a conceptual snippet; in practice use a library.
console.log("Toy attention shown in Python example for brevity.");
```
## Key Takeaways

- Self‑attention learns context‑dependent token relationships.
- Parallelizable training unlocked larger models.
- Positional encodings inject sequence order.
## Next Steps

- Read about embeddings and vector similarity.
- Try a small transformer (e.g., tiny models) to inspect attention maps.
